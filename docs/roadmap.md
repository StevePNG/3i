# React Native Route Planning App Roadmap

## Phase 0 — Discovery & Inception (Week 0-2)
- Capture product vision, success metrics, and target personas (drivers, dispatchers, planners).
- Facilitate service blueprinting and event-storming workshops to map end-to-end flows.
- Translate findings into prioritized epics, Definition of Ready/Done, and initial KPI baselines.
- Produce UX artefacts: map-centric wireframes, navigation flowcharts, and low-fidelity prototypes.

## Phase 1 — Foundation & Tooling (Week 2-4)
- Bootstrap React Native (Expo or bare) monorepo with TypeScript, ESLint, Prettier, Husky hooks, and testing harness (Jest, React Native Testing Library, Detox).
- Establish core packages: `routing-engine`, Tamagui-backed `ui-kit`, `api-client`, `offline-storage`.
- Implement authentication and user profile scaffolding with analytics instrumentation.
- Configure CI/CD (EAS or fastlane) with automated builds, code signing, and OTA rollout channels.

## Phase 2 — Core Navigation Platform (Week 4-8)
- Integrate map provider (Mapbox/MapLibre) with custom layers and gesture handling.
- Build trip planning UI: stop management, search/autocomplete, itinerary overview leveraging Tamagui primitives and tokens.
- Implement routing service integration with dynamic ETA and constraints handling.
- Deliver multi-stop optimization API wrapper plus fallback manual sequencing.
- Persist planned routes locally with background sync queue for offline resilience.

## Phase 3 — Real-Time Intelligence (Week 8-12)
- Stream live traffic, weather, and incident feeds; surface alerts and actionable overlays.
- Schedule background re-routing tasks with push notifications and in-app banners.
- Introduce AI-assisted recommendations: stop prioritization hints, ETA adjustment model.
- Implement audit logging and decision traces for compliance-sensitive customers.

## Phase 4 — Quality, Security & Compliance (Week 10-14)
- Harden access controls, secure storage (Keychain/Keystore), and API request signing.
- Expand automated test suites: integration against mocked routing APIs and device-farm E2E.
- Perform performance tuning (Cold start, frame rate) and accessibility audits (WCAG 2.1 AA).
- Run beta program, capture telemetry dashboards, and iterate on UX pain points.

## Phase 5 — Launch & Iteration (Week 14+)
- Finalize release candidate, run chaos/smoke testing, and prepare release communications.
- Deploy production build, monitor health metrics (crash-free rate, routing success rate).
- Execute post-launch roadmap: dispatcher web portal, enterprise reporting, AI copilots.
- Maintain continuous improvement loop with ADRs and quarterly architectural reviews.

## Team Composition & Governance
- **Product Core**: Product Manager, UI/UX Designer, Frontend Architect, 2-3 React Native engineers.
- **Extended**: Backend engineer (routing service), QA automation, DevOps/Infra, Data Scientist/ML engineer.
- Hold weekly architecture review, daily stand-ups, and bi-weekly design/QA syncs.
- Adopt RFC system for major decisions and maintain ADR repository for traceability.

## Technical Standards
- Enforce TypeScript strictness, Zod-based runtime validation, and dependency update cadence.
- Use Tamagui theme tokens as the primary design system; wrap third-party components with Tamagui for consistency and overridability.
- Use Zustand/Redux Toolkit Query + TanStack Query for state orchestration and caching.
- Store offline assets via SQLite/MMKV with background sync workers using Expo Task Manager or native modules.
- Instrument analytics via Segment/Amplitude; enable feature flags and remote config for experimentation.
