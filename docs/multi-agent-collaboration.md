# Multi-Agent Collaboration Blueprint

This plan assumes autonomous/semiautonomous agents representing each discipline. The UI/UX agent operates independently from implementation agents to preserve design focus and quality.

## Agent Roles & Charters
- **UI/UX Agent (Standalone)**  
  Owns discovery, information architecture, interaction patterns, visual design, accessibility, and usability validation. Maintains source-of-truth design system and prototypes; interacts with other agents only through specified handoff artifacts and design reviews.
- **Product Strategy Agent**  
  Curates roadmap priorities, success metrics, and stakeholder alignment. Accepts discovery outputs from UI/UX agent and turns them into backlog items with Definition of Ready.
- **Frontend Architecture Agent**  
  Governs technical standards, Tamagui design system integration, component library evolution, and code review guidelines. Consolidates UI/UX inputs into implementable specs.
- **Mobile Engineering Agents (React Native)**  
  Implement features, state management, and integrations per specs. Provide feasibility feedback via structured requests rather than ad-hoc design tweaks.
- **Backend/Routing Agent**  
  Delivers routing APIs, optimization services, telemetry endpoints, and data contracts.
- **AI/Intelligence Agent**  
  Builds predictive models (ETA, alerts) and AI assistant logic; coordinates with backend for deployment.
- **QA Automation Agent**  
  Crafts test plans, automated suites (unit/E2E), and release sign-off criteria.
- **DevOps/Platform Agent**  
  Manages CI/CD, infrastructure as code, release channels, monitoring, and incident response.

## Interaction Model
1. **Design Discovery Cycle (UI/UX ↔ Product)**
   - UI/UX agent runs user interviews, journey mapping, and prototype validation.
   - Outputs: Figma (or similar) flows, motion specs, WCAG checklist, design tokens proposals.
   - Product agent converts validated concepts into roadmap epics.
2. **Design Handoff (UI/UX → Frontend Architecture)**
   - Weekly design review; architecture agent verifies technical feasibility and ensures Tamagui token alignment.
   - Deliverables: annotated components, responsive breakpoints, interaction specs, analytics hooks.
3. **Implementation Planning (Frontend Architecture ↔ Engineering Agents)**
   - Architecture agent decomposes UI/UX artifacts into tickets referencing `packages/ui-kit` primitives.
   - Engineering agents estimate and surface constraints; change requests go back through architecture to UI/UX.
4. **Build & Validate**
   - Engineering agents implement; QA agent creates test cases from design acceptance criteria.
   - UI/UX agent reviews staging builds asynchronously; feedback logged as design QA tasks.
5. **Release & Iterate**
   - DevOps handles deployment; Product collects metrics.
   - UI/UX agent analyzes user behavior data and initiates the next discovery loop.

Communication channels:  
- Daily async status updates via project tracker.  
- Weekly cross-agent sync with UI/UX as observer-only unless raising critical design issues.  
- Monthly retrospective focusing on collaboration friction.

## Deliverable Timeline by Phase
Reference `docs/roadmap.md` for macro phases. Each phase includes parallel workstreams with clear entry/exit criteria.

### Phase 0 — Discovery & Inception
- UI/UX: personas, journey maps, low-fidelity prototypes, design principles, Tamagui token draft.
- Product: prioritized epics, KPI definitions, acceptance criteria skeletons.
- Architecture: initial ADRs (monorepo, Tamagui adoption), component taxonomy proposal.

### Phase 1 — Foundation & Tooling
- UI/UX: high-fidelity base components, color/typography scales, map interaction guidelines.
- Architecture: Tamagui config merged, UI kit scaffolding, lint/test pipelines with design lint rules.
- Engineering: skeleton screens using Tamagui primitives, theming toggles.
- QA: baseline smoke test plan covering UI kit.

### Phase 2 — Core Navigation Platform
- UI/UX: detailed screens for planning flow, empty/error/loading states, micro-interactions.
- Engineering: implement trip planner screens, integrate routing service, offline states per design.
- Backend/AI: deliver APIs matching design data contracts.
- QA: automated tests for multi-stop planning flows; design QA checklist executed by UI/UX.

### Phase 3 — Real-Time Intelligence
- UI/UX: alert hierarchy, map overlays, notification UX, AI assistant interactions.
- Engineering/AI: integrate live data feeds, implement assistant interfaces.
- QA: scenario tests for alerts, regression on dynamic styling.

### Phase 4 — Quality, Security & Compliance
- UI/UX: accessibility audits, alternative input flows.
- Engineering: performance optimizations, secure UI handling.
- QA: accessibility automation; UI/UX validates visual parity on target devices.

### Phase 5 — Launch & Iteration
- UI/UX: final polish, release assets, post-launch experiment designs.
- Product: go-to-market materials, feedback loops.
- DevOps/QA: release checklist, monitoring dashboards.

## Governance & Quality Gates
- All UI changes require UI/UX agent approval before merge; tracked via `design-approved` label.
- Architecture agent maintains ADR log; any deviation requires RFC with UI/UX consultation when affecting user flows.
- Sprint definition: UI/UX agent works one sprint ahead, delivering finalized specs before implementation sprint planning.
- Design debt backlog managed separately; prioritized in collaboration with Product and Architecture agents.

## Tooling & Automation Hooks
- Shared design token pipeline (Figma → Tamagui config) with automated tests ensuring parity.
- Storybook/Tamagui playground owned by UI/UX + Architecture for rapid validation.
- Design QA bots comparing screenshots against reference baselines after each PR.

## Escalation Paths
- Conflicting priorities: Product agent mediates; ultimate decision based on user impact metrics.
- Technical infeasibility: Architecture agent proposes alternatives; UI/UX agent adjusts designs.
- Timeline risk: Program manager (could be Product agent dual role) rebalances scope, preserving UI/UX quality bar.
